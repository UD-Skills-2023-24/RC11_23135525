[![Review Assignment Due Date](https://classroom.github.com/assets/deadline-readme-button-24ddc0f5d75046c5622901739e7c5dd533143b0c8e959d652212380cedb1ea36.svg)](https://classroom.github.com/a/YmApcLfC)
There are three Assignment I upload for the Python Class with Julian in FinalAssignment_Julian Folder, the Algorithm Class with Ceel in FinalAssignment_Ceel Folder, the Houdini Class with Joris in FinalAssignment_Joris Folder.

In Ceel's Assignment Folder, there is a notebook file showing the codes of complexity assignment.

In Joris's Assignment Folder, 3 houdini files and 1 json file are included, also a pdf with the extension file link is also in this folder, please follow the pdf to download the full files. Also, here is a quick check for the extension file link on OneDrive:

The folder in the link contains the link files required for the submitted Houdini file, and is divided into categories according to different homework projects. Please refer to the instructions in the pdf for details.

In Julian's Assignment Folder, there is a pdf guidance which includes a link of the full files of the assignment. Here is the quick chek for the link:

Due to the size limited of Github, so all the files including the notebook files were uploaded on the OneDrive, my suggestion is to download the full files on OneDrive and run the notebook.
